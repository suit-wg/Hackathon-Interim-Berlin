# Hackathon & Interop in Berlin

- *Date*: 5-6 June 2018

- *Location*:
	Institute of Computer Science 
	Freie Universität Berlin 
	Room K40 
	Takustr. 9, 
	14195 Berlin 
	Germany

- *Activities*: 
We are planning to do some interoperability testing between the SUIT manifest implementations offered by different groups. We also plan to work on foundational building blocks together (e.g. COSE implementation). Since the IETF#101 Hackathon in London, Inria and FU Berlin have released a new COSE implementation. Arm has released a bootloader, and a manifest generation tool.

- *On-site participation*: if you plan to participate on-site, please register via the dedicated Eventbrige webpage at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ietf-software-updates-for-internet-of-things-suit-hackathon-tickets-46144700040. This will help us with the logistics (e.g. social event preparation). 

- *Remote participation*:
	For remote participation we will use a conference bridge (with Webex), a webcam and a decent microphone. If you plan to participate remotely, please drop a mail to the organizers (contact: Emmanuel <emmanuel.baccelli@inria.fr> and Hannes <hannes.tschofenig@arm.com>). The Webex details can be found below.
