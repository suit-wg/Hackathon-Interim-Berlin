# SUIT Hackathon & Interop in Berlin

- *Date*: 5-6 June 2018

- *Location*:
	Institute of Computer Science 
	Freie Universität Berlin 
	Room K40 
	Takustr. 9, 
	14195 Berlin 
	Germany

- *Activities*: 
We are planning to do some interoperability testing between the [SUIT manifest](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-moran-suit-manifest-01) implementations offered by different groups. We also plan to work on foundational building blocks together (e.g. COSE implementation). Since the IETF#101 Hackathon in London, Inria and FU Berlin have released a new COSE implementation. Arm has released a bootloader, and a manifest generation tool.

- *On-site participation*: if you plan to participate on-site, please register via the dedicated Eventbrige webpage at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ietf-software-updates-for-internet-of-things-suit-hackathon-tickets-46144700040. This will help us with the logistics (e.g. social event preparation). 

- *Remote participation*:
	For remote participation we will use a conference bridge (with Webex), a webcam and a decent microphone. If you plan to participate remotely, please drop a mail to the organizers (contact: Emmanuel <emmanuel.baccelli@inria.fr> and Hannes <hannes.tschofenig@arm.com>). The Webex details can be found below.
